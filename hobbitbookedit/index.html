		    <p class="indented-paragraph">
I felt these films had "too much," whether it was all the sideplots, CGI, action, or new characters. As a huge fan of the book, I decided to edit these movies down to match closer to what Tolkien wrote while also rectifying my own critiques. This project is for both the purist and casual fans alike, with the end result providing a more focused narrative that I find more enjoyable and emotionally impactful.</p>
    <p class="indented-paragraph">
                I initially edited with the book at my side, page by page, starting on June 19th, 2019. After numerous revisions to make the edit actually work for general audiences and feel as professional as possible, I finished on December 24th, 2021. I did one last revision in September 2023, where I am now fully satisfied with the cut after many years of work.</p>

                <li class="list-group-item"><b>1) Be more faithful to <i>The Hobbit</i> by J.R.R. Tolkien</b> while still following Peter Jackson’s Middle Earth vision. Includes making the story focus on the main quest & also decreasing the numerous references to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, allowing both stories to stand on their own.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>2) Consistent tone</b> as the story progresses from its lighthearted beginning to more serious ending. With this, display a convincing atmosphere with more realistic combat and physics. This aids in allowing <i>The Hobbit</i> to transition more naturally into the <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> films from an atmospheric perspective.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>3) Execute with professional film editing techniques</b>, specifically with making smooth audio transitions, maintaining a proper surround sound mix, and keeping intact the pacing, character arcs, and story structure. Work with lossless sources and avoid any unnecessary quality loss.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>4) Stay in Middle Earth as long as possible</b> with our beloved characters, meaning all available footage (theatrical, extended, and deleted) has been considered. Cutting characterization or book-accurate moments just for the sake of runtime is avoided; hence, <b>this edit is branded as its own "Extended Edition"</b> to justify the runtime, fitting perfectly as a prelude to any <i>Lord of the Rings</i> Extended Edition marathon.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>5) Appeal to all movie fans</b>, regardless of what their prior knowledge is with any of the Middle Earth books or original films. Understanding the narrative should not depend on other external material.</li>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Added 35mm film grain overlay throughout the entire trilogy to reduce the digital look.  
                      <li>The saturation, vibrancy, and green levels have been decreased where necessary to tone down the original color grading, removing the excess colorfullness and greenish tint. These changes vary in intensity throughout the edit - below in the Shire the colors only needed a small nudge.

                <i><p class="indented-paragraph">While it was my goal to match these films to the book (which can be silly), I felt Jackson went too far with immature humor that did not honor the tone that Tolkien achieved. Cheap humor like Ori’s loud burp, Bombur “eating cheese by the block,” or shoving an axe up Smaug's "jacksy" are some of the examples I cut, while I instead opted to only keep humor that does do the spirit of the book justice. I maintained this philosophy for the entire edit, as I do love that the book was full of plenty of witty, ironic, and lighthearted/charming humor.</p></i>

                <li class="list-group-item"><b>Extended Scenes Kept:</b> Most of the Shire market scene with Bilbo is kept to give us more time with him and the Hobbits so we can appreciate the contrast in lifestyle once we enter the wild.

                <li class="list-group-item">When the Company hears Orcs at night it serves as foreshadowing for when an Orc pack shows up to attack them later after the Goblin caves.</li>

As soon as Elrond and Gandalf walk off at night, we cut away with a new music transition to various establishing shots of Rivendell in the morning with Bilbo (who no longer finds the Shards of Narsil).<br>
                <i>The heavy handed connections to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> films throughout <i>The Hobbit</i> films felt out of place and unnecessary in my viewing experience, especially considering my goal of being accurate to the book (which didn't have any of these connections or fan service moments).

                <li class="list-group-item"><b>Extended Scenes Kept:</b> All of the Rivendell extended material pertaining to Bilbo & the quest is kept. We get more dialogue with Gandalf/Bilbo before they enter the valley, a well-needed discussion between Gandalf/Elrond to explain the grander purpose of this quest, and a beautiful scene with Elrond/Bilbo which not only introduces their friendship, but also sets up Bilbo's motivations moving into the Misty Mountains.</li>

                <li class="list-group-item"><b>Extended Scenes Kept:</b> Thorin has an additional piece of dialogue at the gate which mirrors the book and we also get another line from Gandalf. At the start of the battle, we see more of the Dwarf army and Thranduil/Dain fighting, which aids in maintaining the pacing of the battle to account for all the intolerable action I have cut. After Thorin's final charge, we also see some extended clips of the Company fighting Orcs during the rescored "Misty Mountains" montage, and then a few more extended seconds of Beorn fighting at the end.</li>

Additionally, this means Gandalf does not mention the ring because he still has no idea Bilbo has it (even if he is suspicious), we see him discover the ring in <i>The Fellowship of the Ring.</i></li>
