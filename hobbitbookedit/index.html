				<li class="list-group-item">A fan edit that combines Peter Jackson's <i>The Hobbit</i> trilogy into a more captivating faithfully adapted single-movie experience.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><i>I felt that the trilogy had "too much," whether it be all the sideplots, CGI, action, or its overall length. As a huge fan of the book who also wanted to enjoy the film version, I decided to edit the movies down to fit with what Tolkien wrote, which coincided with rectifying all of said critiques. Not only did I make this project for us purist Tolkien fans, but also for casual audiences who may just prefer a more digestible and focused narrative, regardless of the book. As a result, I have created a new presentation of what a standalone "extended" Hobbit movie could have been like, which I find to be a more enjoyable and emotionally impactful adaptation for all audiences to enjoy. 
                <br><br>
                I started this project on June 19th 2019, where I initially edited the trilogy with the book at my side, page by page. Since then, the edit has gone through numerous revisions and adjustments to be as seamless and professional as possible until finally being completed as of December 24th 2021, two and a half years later.</i></li>

              <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>1)</b> Be more faithful to <i>The Hobbit</i> by J.R.R. Tolkien while still being under Peter Jackson’s vision. This includes making the film focus solely on the main quest (without distracting sideplots/sidecharacters) & also decreasing the numerous references to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> films, allowing both stories to stand on their own.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>2)</b> Consistent tone as the story progresses from its lighthearted beginning to more serious ending. With this, a convincing atmosphere displaying more realistic combat, visuals, and physics is present throughout. This aids in allowing <i>The Hobbit</i> to transition more naturally into the <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> films from an atmospheric perspective.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>3)</b> Execute with professional film editing techniques, specifically with making smooth audio transitions, maintaining a proper surround sound mix, and keeping intact the pacing, character arcs, and story structure. Work with lossless sources and avoid any unnecessary quality loss.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>4)</b> Stay in Middle Earth as long as possible with our beloved characters, meaning all available footage (theatrical, extended, and deleted) has been considered. Cutting characterization or book-accurate moments just for the sake of runtime is avoided; hence, this edit is presented as its own "Extended Edition" that can fit well with any Middle Earth saga marathon.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>5)</b> Appeal to all movie fans, regardless of what their prior knowledge is with any of the Middle Earth books or original films. Understanding the narrative should not depend on other external material.</li>

                    <ul>
                      <li>Added subtle 35mm film grain overlay throughout the entire trilogy to reduce the digital look.

I read the book while editing to make sure I could stay as faithful as possible, all while still respecting the limitations that follow: I only have access to the existing footage, films inherently need to be more cinematic & dramatic than their book counterpart, and the presentation needs to be cohesive for viewers who have not read the book.

                <li class="list-group-item">The “Sack of Erebor” flashback has been cut, leaving only a short prologue with old Bilbo, now beginning with <i>“In a hole in the ground...”</i> All Frodo dialogue has been removed, instead leaving him with only a short visual cameo. After just a few minutes, we begin the main story of young Bilbo, cutting past the original film title screen, as this edit is only titled <i>The Hobbit</i>.</li>

                <br>
                <i>While it was my goal to match these films to the book, I felt Jackson went too far with immature humor that did not honor the tone for which Tolkien intended. Cheap humor like Ori’s gross loud burp, Bombur “eating cheese by the block,” or shoving an axe up Smaug's "jacksy" are some of the examples I cut, while I instead opted to only keep humor that actually does do the spirit of the book justice. This philosophy was maintained for the entirety of the edit, as I completely understand that the book was full of humor, but usually of a more witty, ironic, or charming manner.</i>
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>Extended Scenes Kept:</b> Most of the Shire market scene with Bilbo is kept to give us more time with him and the Hobbits so we can appreciate the contrast in lifestyle once we enter the wild. I also have included some extra Dwarf characterization for both Óin and Bifur, as I want to give the audience as much of the lesser popular Dwarves as I could.</li>

                <li class="list-group-item">When the Company hears Orcs at night it serves as foreshadowing for when an Orc pack shows up to attack them later after the Goblin caves.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Removed Radagast entirely from the film, instead leaving just a few of Gandalf's references to his existence for the sake of world building.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Trimmed some of the worst silly moments in the Troll sequence to stay in line with my philosophy of reaching a tone that respects the book's lightheartedness, but does not make a mockery of it.</li>

                <li class="list-group-item">Instead of Radagast showing up after the Troll cave and beginning the ensuing Warg chase, the music transitions into a new hiking montage using footage taken from later in the film, showing the Company progress towards Rivendell.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">As always, removed the most offending silly moments, including cutting the Elf-Dwarf romance jokes and trimming out the Dwarves swimming in a fountain.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">The White Council scene is cut and an abbreviated version can be found on my Special Features. As soon as Elrond and Gandalf walk off at night, we cut away with a new music transition to various establishing shots of Rivendell in the morning with Bilbo (who no longer finds the Shards of Narsil).<br>
                <i>The heavy handed connections to <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> films throughout <i>The Hobbit</i> films felt out of place and unnecessary in my viewing experience, especially considering my goal of being accurate to the book (which didn't have any of these connections or fan service moments). As such, I have cut back on these aspects. Instead, we enjoy connections between the two stories through more subtle references.</i>
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item"><b>Extended Scenes Kept:</b> All of the Rivendell extended material pertaining to Bilbo & the quest is kept. We get more dialogue with Gandalf/Bilbo before they enter the valley, a well-needed discussion between Gandalf/Elrond to explain the grander purpose of this quest, and a beautiful scene with Elrond/Bilbo which not only introduces their friendship, but also sets up Bilbo's motivations moving into the Misty Mountains.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><b>Editors Audio Commentary:</b> Audio track discussing every change made in this project. I talk not just about where changes were made, but also why and how they were done. <i>This is also accessible on the MKV release.</i>
            <li><b>Bonus Scenes:</b> Scenes from the original movies that did not make it into the final cut, but were still interesting nonetheless. This includes “Durin’s Folk” (Flashbacks from Erebor, Moria, and Bree), as well as “The White Council,” and even some deleted scenes of enjoyable moments that just couldn’t make the cut for various reasons.
            <li><b>Music:</b> “Misty Mountains”& “Blunt the Knives” playable from the menu in their full studio quality.
            <li><b>Release Trailer:</b> Promotional trailer that shows off some of the changes and edits.
            <li><b>Behind the Scenes:</b> A recording of what the project looks like in my editing software, over viewing how everything was put together and some of my common techniques.
